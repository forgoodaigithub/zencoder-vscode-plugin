Zencoder leverages a specialized proprietary AI pipeline for code generation, ensuring that the generated code is usable from the start. This proprietary AI pipeline achieves industry-leading compilation rates, making the development process more efficient. Developers can use natural language to request code generation, automating tedious tasks and enabling them to focus on innovation. This feature not only speeds up development but also enhances overall productivity and faster product delivery.

### Unit Testing

Unit test generation is a critical part of our code generation pipeline, ensuring that the generated code is robust and reliable. By automating unit test creation and execution, Zencoder helps maintain high code quality and reduces the time developers spend on writing tests manually. This automation streamlines the development process, allowing developers to concentrate on creating innovative solutions and improving the overall software quality.

### Docstring Generation
